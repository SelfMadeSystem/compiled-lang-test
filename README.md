# Compiled Lang Test

This is a test of a compiled language using Rust and Inkwell.

Right now, the language is literally just a simple calculator, but I plan to expand it to be a full language.

See [Interpreted Lang Test](https://github.com/SelfMadeSystem/interpreted-lang-test)
to see the interpreted language I made. I plan to make this language similar to that one (second iteration).

## Usage

To use the language, you can run the following command:

```sh
cargo run
```

Edit the `main.rs` file to change the code that is run.
